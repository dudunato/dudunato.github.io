    <div class="pray-slogan">Learning to be a Listener</div>

    <p> I am not a good listener at all. I always want to share things that happen to me and I don’t like to listen others. This is a bad thing that I’ve been improving that since my teenager ages. So, in the beginning of this week a voice came in my mind saying: “Dude, how do you want to listen God’s voice if we are not a good listener?”. Oh man! It hurts! Just God knows, how i’ve been fighting against it. It’s not that I don’t care about people, it is because I am always worried about the practical way to resolve things. But, sometimes people just want to talk, they don’t want to “get things done” or see their situation solved in that moment. They just want to be listened. So, God told me that I need to became a good listener. Be late to say, be late to the end of talk and enjoy the relationship’s aspect of hearing. This is not new for me, God is working with me on it for a while it just came again on this week and I felt like I should share. So, I am always open to change and my praying is may God show me when I need to stay and listen either His voice or other’s voice. Amém (Portuguese)!</p>
