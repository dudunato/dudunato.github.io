    <p>Worthy servant</p>
    <p> I want to share what God told me in the forest. I went there in my application time and I felt like God was guiding me to a place that I couldn’t hear any cars or people talking, just the nature. So I did it. I went to the very middle in the forest and I asked God to talk to me what He had to me. God asked me if I were tired and quickly I answered Him: “Hey God, you know that I’m tired, but You also know that I’m happy. I’m tired because the DTS in pretty intense and I have that project from Brazil to finish and I don’t have a lot of time to do it”. When I said it to God a text came into my mind. It was Luke 17.7 which says: “Will any one of you who has a servant plowing or keeping sheep say to him when he has come in from the field, ‘Come at once and recline at table’? Will he not rather say to him, ‘Prepare supper for me, and dress properly, and serve me while I eat and drink, and afterward you will eat and drink’? Does he thank the servant because he did what was commanded? So you also, when you have done all that you were commanded, say, ‘We are unworthy servants; we have only done what was our duty”. And when I read it another verse came in my mind, it was: Matthew 10.12 "From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force”.</p>
    <p>So, I really felt like the unworthy servant, I am tired of doing what was commanded to me! In his Kingdom we need to go beyond, If some one ask us to god one mile we need to take him two miles. And his Kingdom is taken by force! We need to spend our strength, our energy, our breath entirely in his Kingdom. When these thoughts came into my mind I just thought: "but God I’m tired how can I do something properly so tired”. It was really funny when I said it to God, cause He answered me right away just a few verses ahead of Mathew 10.12, now it is Mathew 12.28: “Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest”. Our God is so awesome that He solves everything for us. He ask us to take His Kingdom by force, to go beyond our tasks and He promises us that He is going to give us rest. God is good all the time, all the time God is good!</p>
    <p>Of course we are going to be tired if we work a lot, but in His kingdom we felt complete when we go beyond. Once we finish our daily work and we fulfilled everything what He put in our hands to do we felt fulfilled for something from Heaven! Such a Word of encouragement! Amém! </p>
