      <span>Family</span>

      <p>I was raised in a Baptist Church where my parents taught me about Jesus and the Bible Principles. My mother, especially, told me how to love God’s word. Later, during my adolescence I had many experiences with Jesus in camps, and the love for Christ was increasing. My parents were totally involved in missions administration at church and that gave me the opportunity to know many missionaries who told me a lot of histories. Since then I am involved with missions in the Church. When I was 17 years old I knew Alissa my wife and knew her father who is Pastor of the church named VIDE where I am today. In that church I was discipled and I could learn a lot of new things about the Gospel. Furthermore, my interest in going deeper with that made me study hard and I was invited to teach Sunday School and to be a Youth Leader. I passed the last 4 years leading the youth ministry and the last year my wife and I were called to be part of leadership of the Mission’s Ministry. Last year, we went to a Missions Course and during that God called us to dedicate our talents entirely to Him, so hearing His voice we started to pray about one place to learn more about missions, to work and give the best of what we have to offer to God. Our church is really involved in missions because our Pastor (Alissa’s Father) was a missionary in England and Germany. And we feel that God is calling us to learn more about him and work with missions in YWAM Lausanne.</p>

      <span>Future</span>
      <p>I hope to keep working in His kingdom. Idon’t want to come back to work in a normal company. I feel that God is leading me to something related to technology and missions. If God permits, I want to stay in YWAM Lausanne as a Staff and learn more from this amazing community and how to work as community in missions. I really hope to spend the rest of my life doing missions. I love it and somehow I feel God calling me to this future. Amen!</p>
