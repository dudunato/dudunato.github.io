    <p>Heavenly God,</p>
    <br>
    <p>First of all I would like to say thank you for bringing me here to YWAM Lausanne and for being present in this whole process. You have taken care of my family in each detail and I have no words to express what is inside of me. Thank you, Father.</p>
    <br>
    <p>As you have been saying to me I want to hear from you more than I have ever heard before. I know that you brought me here for me to go deeper. So I pray for you God to give me strength, energy and discipline to worship you more, to read your word and to obey you in every command you say to me. Also, I hope to give you more than I have given, my family, my skills, my money, my everything belongs to you Lord. Help me fulfill these promises.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I know that this time is a time to <strong>learn from You</strong> as you said to me. So Iâ€™m writing this letter to register in words what you have put in my heart. Yes, Jesus, I need to learn everything from You, I need to be more humble, I need to be more gentle as you are. </p>
    <br>
    <p>Therefore, I submit myself to you God. Change my life once again as you have done daily, but may this time be marked in my heart as the time that I decided to receive something new from you every single day.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Amen,</p>
    <br>
    <p>Dudu Nato.</p>
