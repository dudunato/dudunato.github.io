    <p>A place to Be</p>
    <p>Isaiah 54.2 "Enlarge the place of your tent, and let the curtains of your habitations be stretched out; do not hold back; lengthen your cords and strengthen your stakes."</p>
    <p>We don’t have the dimension of God’s Kingdom. What I mean is that we cannot measure His Kingdom. Also, we cannot buy I ticket to go to this Kingdom. It is not a place to get, neither a place to do tourism. In fact it is not even in the map. So, why do we keep talking about it as if it was a place to get? This is an awesome question. Actually, God’s Kingdom is the only Kingdom that is in every single place. It doesn’t require borders. There is no airport for you to land. There is no passport either. In this place everyone has the same nationality. Also, it doesn’t require you to be successful. In this place, there is no currency or economy. There is no competition either. There is no rush. Therefore, this is the place where peace is the only arbitrator. There is only one law: to love. There is only one people: God’s people. There is only one King: Jesus. There are a lot of lands: all hearts. There are a lot of cultures as well. This place is where the beauty of each culture is linked in one voice with multiple talents singing only one song: He is the King.</p>
    <p>In His Kingdom, there are no borders or embassies requiring documents for us to be able to get in. The only requirement to get in this Kingdom is to accept the King in your heart. And then live a new life. A life where He tells you to go and you go. And when He tells you to go all doors are going to be opened. We live in this divided world and yet we can live in God’s Kingdom. It’s up to you, you choose it. Once you chose it, there are no countries anymore, but there are missions fields. There is no visa process anymore, but there are steps of faith. There is no money needed, but there is dependency on Him. There is no hunger, but there is a requirement to sit with Him everyday and have the divine breakfast together. As I said before, it is not a place to get, but it is a place to Be.</p>
    <p>Do you want to Be in this place? “Enlarge the place of your tent, and let the curtains of your habitations be stretched out; do not hold back, lengthen your cords and strengthen yours stakes”.</p>
    <p>In His Kingdom, <br>Dudu Nato.</p>
