    <span class="number">1. Each one Reach one and teach one, each year the rest of life. I wanted to copy this phrase here, because this is something that I need to practice :D</span>

    <span class="number">2. Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving</span>

    <p>Colossians 4:3-6 "At the same time, pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ, on account of which I am in prison— that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak. Walk in wisdom toward outsiders, making the best use of the time. Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person"</p>

    <span class="number">3. We do need to live the Gospel, but we also need to proclaim the Gospel, to share, to say to people that there are the good news from God, everything was paid! </span>

    <p>Luke 4:18-19 "“The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor"</p>

    <p>Pr. Gibson was really special to me. Because I’ve heard about share the gospel a ton of times, but not like this. He showed it to us in a simpler and soft way. It was so awesome to see him sharing the Gospel with people on local outreach. It inspires me, makes me want to share the Gospel. For sure, he is one that is going to be remembered in my heart for my whole life. I want to have the same smile that he has when he is share about the Good News!</p>
