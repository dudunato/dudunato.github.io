    <p>Jesus came to give us life an abundantly life (John 10:10). This is so precious. If we take a look in the context that Jesus is saying this, we are going to realize that He has a statement with a condition of hearing His voice: “but the sheep that did no listem them” and “they will listen to my voice” (John 10:17-19). So, Jesus came to give us plenitude in everything, but it requires that we’re prepared to invest time in His presence. Because just doing like this we are going to be able to hear His voice. Furthermore, as Paul Hawkins said, to recognize His voice we need to practice it! Therefore, I’ll invest my whole strength to hear God day-by-day in my life. I really want to recognize His voice as much as I recognize my daughter’s voice (haha). So I really want to live my life in plenitude and I know that in Jesus this is possible. However, I know that it’s not easy and I need to abdicate a lot of rights in my life, but I am prepared to do whatever I need to do to live an abundantly life!</p>
