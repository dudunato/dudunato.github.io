    <p>God has given me peace</p>
    <p>This week happened something really amazing in my relationship with God. It was in the last community service that we were supposed to donate an amount that God speaks to us. And in that service in the moment that we were praying about to give our donation, Alissa and I got an amount and we decided together to give whatever we both got without complaining. So, we went to the front of the room together and put our commitment in there. In the same moment my family felt so happy about giving with our whole heart an amount that God spoke to us and we didn’t care about if the amount is to high for us. We didn’t care about our outreach, because we don’t have the whole money yet, as well. We just obeyed God.</p>
    <p>After the service we arrived in our room and I felt like I should talk to God. I wanted to spend more time with Him after that amazing service. And then I opened the bible and said to God, “hey God speaks to me whatever you want me to hear”. So God gave me theses verses: "I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived your concern for me. You were indeed concerned for me, but you had no opportunity. Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need. I can do all things through him who strengthens me” (Philippians 4:10-13) "And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus” (Philippians 4:19). When I read these verses it blew my mind, totally. I was like: “hey God, you know my heart and you saw that I gave that with my whole heart and now you share with me that you are going to take care of me. You God, are awesome!!!”.</p>
    <p>We always know that God is taking care of us, but in that night God wanted to speak with me loudly. He wanted to let me know that He is here with me looking after my family and whatever we really need. So, in this experience I tasted a lot of God’s character, but if I need to summarize this experience I would say that God has given me peace: "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you. Not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your hearts be troubled, neither let them be afraid” (John 14:27) </p>
