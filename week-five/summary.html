    <span class="number">1. <strong>God is love</strong>. This is one of the sentences most spoken by Christians and it seems to be cliché, but it isn’t! As much as we go deeper in knowing God He reveals more of His love.</span>

    <p>Rom 9.38-39 "For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers, nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord"</p>

  <div class="topic" style="float: right; border-bottom: 1px solid #3892f9;">
    <span class="number">2. God is always looking for opportunity to redeem us from our transgression. He is always knocking in our door’s heart and we don’t open it!</span>

    <p>Eh 2:4-6 "But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ— by grace you have been saved— and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus"</p>
  </div>

  <div class="topic" style="clear: right;  border-bottom: 1px solid #3bad14;">
    <span class="number">3. He always is with us in every situation if we seek Him!</span>

    <p>Acts 17:27 "that they should seek God, and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us"</p>
  </div>

  <div class="message-desc">
    <p>"There is no religion that has a personal God but Christianity and that is awesome. We are not following an ideology or philosophy. We are in a relationship with a person. A person that speaks to us, that show us His character and more than that we’re close to a sovereign God which died for us to pay the price we couldn’t pay by ourselves!"</p>
