    <p>God is good, all the time!</p>
    <p>I think that was Epicurus that made the question about the relation between the God’s omnipotence and God’s goodness. The question is like this: if there is a God, He is all-powerful and He is good, if He weren’t all-powerful, He wouldn’t be God, and if He weren’t good, he wouldn’t be a worthy God. However, if God is all-powerful and good, how can we explain so much suffering around the world? Whether God is all-powerful, then He can avoid the suffering, and whether He doesn’t do that is because He is not good, so in this case, He is unworthy to be God. But, Whether God is good and want to avoid the suffering and doesn’t do that, it’s because God is not able to avoid it. So God is not all-powerful, and in this case, also cannot be called God. Leonardo Boff, is a Brazilian theologian and writer, has written about the Tsunami: “If God is omnipotent, He can do everything. So why Did He not avoid the seaquake? If He didn’t avoid it, this is a signal that neither God is omnipotent nor good”. Considering, therefore, it is not possible that God is in the same time good and all-powerful, the logic is that God is a philosophical impossibility, or if you prefer, the ideia of God does not make sense and the best thing to do is accept that there is no God, right? No.</p>
    <p>It seems that we are facing an insoluble dilemma. But Einstein gave us a precious tip. He said that when we are facing a "insoluble problem”, we must change the paradigm of thinking that created the problem. The paradigm of thinking that assumes the binomial “omnipotence/goodness” as a starting point to think God’s character put us in a bad situation. Is there, however, other paradigm of thinking? I wonder if the words “omnipotence” and “goodness” are the best words to summarize the God's dilemma in face the evil and the innocent’s suffering. So, is there others words that we can use in this puzzle?</p>
    <p>This situation was faced by Paul, the apostle, when he was debating with the greek philosophers in his time. The christian message was so simple: God came to the world and died crucified. Even worst: God was crucified in a "kind of game” between jews and romans, this is really different in relation to others gods, the christian God was not killed by more powerful gods, but He was killed by men. Being God, He could never be killed by human hands, and being all-powerful God, He could never even be killed. Paul, was, therefore, facing a similar problem raised by Epicurus: God was a philosophical impossibility.</p>
    <p>That was when the apostles raised a genial answer that the christians believe it was blown by the Holy Spirit: before coming to world to meet the men, God emptied of His omnipotence (Philippians 2.6-8), He relinquished to exert His omnipotence, and He did it for love (John 3.16), God let himself be killed by them (Acts 2.23). (I said that “God relinquished to exert His omnipotence”, this is different of saying that “God relinquished His omnipotence”).</p>
    <p>Paul, the apostle, admitted that it wasn’t possible to think in God without considering the binomial goodness/omnipotence. He opted to use the word Love, as well as John which affirmed that “God is love” (1 John 4.7-8). Jesus of Nazareth was God in the flesh in love shape, and not God in flesh in omnipotence shape. The christians, we don’t say “God is the power”, we say “God is love”.</p>
    <p>It makes perfectly good sense. A God that would come to meet people dressed by omnipotence armor, would come to impose and to claim restricted obedience, and the people would be impressed by His majesty and not compared power. Jung Mo Sung, a Korean-brazilian theologian, adverts  that “the return of the power is obedience, while the return of love is freedom”. When Paul affirmed that what makes people to live for Christ is His love that control us - the love that was demonstrated in the cross (2 Corinthians 5.14-15). Is not the God’s power that attract people’s heart, but His unconditional Love.</p>
    <p>In fact, “God didn’t have choice”. When He decides to make the human in His image after likeness, He should make the man free. Wishing a relationship with the human being, He should give to the human the freedom to voluntarily respond His love. Only the love would solve this equation, because only the love releases freedom for the other be able to even reject the love that the lover wants to give.</p>
    <p>André Comte-Spovile is an atheist that writes about the divine love like fews I ever read. He believes that the divine love is a decreasing act, a weakness, a relinquishment. He uses the arguments of Simone Weil: “The creation is from God’s part an act of not expanding himself, but relinquish himself. God and all creation is less then God alone. God accepted to be decreased. He abdicated a part of His being. He emptied himself already in this act. It’s why John says that the Lamb was slain before the foundations of the world. God allowed to exists different things that are infinitely lower value than Him. For the creative act He denied himself, as Christ prescribe to us to deny ourselves. God denied in our favor for give us the possibility to deny ourselves for Him. The religions that have devised this relinquishment, this volunteer distance, this volunteer payment from God, his absence in prol of his secret presence here in the earth, these religions are the true religion, the translation in different languages of the great Revelation. The religions that represent the divinity commanding in every side where it has power to do so are fake. Even though monotheist, they are idolaters” (Comte-Sponville, André, Pequeno tratado das grandes virtudes, São Paulo: Martins Fontes, 1995, Chapter 18: Amor.).</p>
    <p>Now you are imagining where I want to get with this, right? That’s right, between the God’s omnipotence and God’s goodness there is man’s freedom and the God’s commitment in respect this freedom. This helps to understand why there are so much suffering in the world. The evil doesn’t come from God and it’s not promoted or determined by God. The evil is an inevitable consequence of human’s freedom, that decides to turn his back to God and try to rule the world in his ideias. Before the evil and the suffering, God with men, incarnated in love, also suffers, has compassion (Matthew 9.36; 14.14). And died. The God Love incarnated in Jesus of Nazareth is like this, between killing and dying, He prefers to die.</p>
    <p>But you could question what is the reason that God doesn’t finish with the evil. This is simple: God doesn’t finish with the evil because the evil doesn’t exists by itself, the evil just exists when someone produces it. The evil is not an entity beside God. The evil is the result of human acting far away from God, the Greatest Good. The christian monotheism argue that there is only one God and the evil is the restriction of God’s presence. The christians we are not dualists saying that there is good and evil. The evil is just the absence of good. Because of that, the evil doesn’t exist, what exists is who produces the evil, that one that produces the evil because is far from God, the only one, the greatest Good.</p>
    <p>Ariovaldo Ramos, another Brazilian theologian, says that: “for God finish the evil, He would have to finish with who produces it”. But, being Love, between finish with who produces the evil and redeem who produces it, God choose to suffers while redeeming, for not deny Himself destroying the object of His love. For this reason God decreased himself, He emptied himself of His all-powerfulness, and gave up the right of being in an omnipotence-obediency relationship and choose to be in a love relationship, making his sun rise on the evil and on the good (Matthew 5.44-45), and showing his goodness giving rain from heaven and harvest in the right time, providing sustain in a great abundance and giving the men a joyful heart (Acts 14.17).</p>
    <p>The equation love and freedom in God’s and men relationship results in one scandal: a God who suffers for love. And when God suffers, the men suffer. Or, indeed, God suffers because the men suffer, God suffers because He loves the man that suffers.</p>
    <p>God is good, all the time. All the time, God is good. Because that is His nature.</p>
