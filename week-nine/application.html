    <p>This week something really important was confirmed to me. I am among christians for my whole life, and there are just a few of them that really marked my life. And I realized that all of them had something in common. They were meditators, they were/are into the process of emptying themselves day by day. Because this is what meditation is all about: It is the process of emptying ourselves and filling ourselves with the revelation of the Holly Spirit. I am totally convinced that there is no way to be influent as a real christian without spend time personally with God to fill us with His presence. So, I already was doing this almost everyday, but now, I’m doing it every single day as priority. So everyday, after my breakfast I am doing it, having my single time with God and then I’ll go to meditation class and stay with Liz for Alissa be able to meditate as well. But I love the fact of doing it before everyone. I don’t think meditation works in Group, this is not meditation it is prayer meeting (it works), but meditation itself is all about you and God. So, as Pr. David Ross told us, it is to violently turn my ear to hear what God want to speak to me.</p>
